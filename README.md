# Functions Continous Deployment demo (using VSTS)

This is a simple Azure Functions project (requires Visual Studio 2017 + Functions Tools) that listens for new Documents in Cosmos DB and then sends their contents as an email via SendGrid.

It is used to demonstrate how we can deploy to Azure using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) even when the source repository is Github.

I'll update this repository once the video / blog is up.
